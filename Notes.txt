Questions 
-- What is yup 
-- JSON vs JSONP



Naming convention 
-- userRoute.js 
-- user.route.js 
both are good, still user.route.js recommended 



Routing concept 

-- 1. Within the "profile" route:
-- The "login" and "register" routes are nested under the "/profile" path. These routes are intended to be used within the context of the user's profile. When a user navigates to "/profile/login" or "/profile/register", they are accessing authentication-related functionalities within their profile.

-- 2. Outside of the "profile" route:
-- The "login" and "register" routes are also defined separately at the root level of the router. These routes are standalone routes accessible directly from the root path ("/"). They are not nested under the "/profile" path. These routes may serve as entry points for users who want to directly access the login or registration functionality without going through their profile.
